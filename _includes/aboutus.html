<section class="aboutus"><div class="flex flex-right"><div class="col-right"><div class="aboutus-text"><p>At Siq Liquid, we started out with a simple goal, we wanted to give vapers access to an e-liquid at an affordable price. However, there are tons of companies doing that (sort of) already. Our mission takes it a few steps further.</p><br/><p>Siq Liquid is unique in that while the price is lower than most all competitors, the juice is still made from the highest quality American made products we can source, all of our ingredients are USDA Food Grade approved, and are made in the United States of America. Additionally, you'll find that with many other juice companies they feel the need to market their less expensive juice as "budget juice," as if that's an excuse for their poor quality, but not us. Siq Liquid is a premium juice that will taste as good or better than any $22 dollar (or more) bottle you purchase. Many of the other brands cut corners, and while the juice may taste good at first, it is packed with sweeteners, additives, and cheap ingredients, leaving your coils black and gunked up in about an hour. We didn't cut those corners, we just cut the price.</p></div><div class="mobile-bg"></div></div></div></section>
